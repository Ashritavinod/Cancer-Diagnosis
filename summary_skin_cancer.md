# Summary: Skin Cancer Classification using AlexNet

## Dataset
- A skin cancer image dataset (e.g., HAM10000 or a similar dataset)
- Images categorized into multiple classes of skin lesions (e.g., Melanoma, Nevus, BCC, etc.)

## Model
- AlexNet architecture adapted for multi-class image classification
- Transfer learning used with pre-trained weights (if applicable)
- Final dense layer adjusted to match number of classes

## Workflow
1. Image loading and preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
2. Splitting into training, validation, and test sets
3. Model building using AlexNet or a similar deep CNN
4. Compilation with categorical crossentropy and optimizer (e.g., Adam)
5. Training and evaluation
6. Performance visualization using accuracy/loss curves and confusion matrix

## Results
- High classification accuracy achieved through deep feature learning
- Suitable for real-world medical image classification tasks

## Key Takeaways
- AlexNet remains a solid architecture for image classification tasks
- Transfer learning improves performance, especially on limited datasets
